                <h2>About Frank the dog sitter</h2>
                <p>I've worked in animal hospitals all through high school and have been dog sitting and dog walking various roommates' dogs throughout college.Now that I have graduated, I've got a 9-5 desk job that I enjoy, but also student loans that I don't enjoy.
                <p>Let me give you peace of mind when you are away that your dog(s) are in good care. It will reduce your stress and let you travel worry free.</p>
                <p>I'm dependable and know what to do should an issue arise. I have reliable transportation and local references upon request.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Franklyn was fantastic! From the initial meeting through the entire stay, I was totally happy with the entire process of booking Franklyn. I have 3 senior dogs and live in a remote remote mountain community, but felt 100% at ease knowing that Franklyn was there to make sure that everyone was happy and healthy on our trip. I would absolutely use Franklyn again for future sitting and would highly recommend him for other pet owners. He was professional, attentive and overall just a great person to work with.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Franklyn did a GREAT job staying at our house and taking care of our two young labs. This is the first time we've tried a service like Rover, and we were a little concerned about turning our dogs and our house over to someone we didn't know. But we had a good Meet&Greet beforehand and we really liked Franklyn. We just got back from our 4-night trip, and everything went well. The dogs loved him and he took great care of our house. He also kept us updated through our trip with pictures and messages to set our minds at ease. We highly recommend Franklyn!</p>
